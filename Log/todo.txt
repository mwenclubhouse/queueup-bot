* Create a storage/management system for discord IDs 
    - Possibly a file.ts that returns values of each of the IDs
    - Store each ID in firebase
* Create an init function that intializes the discord server to be compatable with bot
* Add feature to allow bot to delete messages of helped students
* figure out how to bulk delete messages that are older than 14 days (bulkDelete function does not do this)
